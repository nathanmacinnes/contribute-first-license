# Contribute-First License
_A new open source license permitting derivative works only by previous
contributors_

_Version 0.1.0_

This new license is pretty permissive, but only if you are a previous
contributor. Otherwise it's quite restrictive, but gives a few permissions to
help people do practical things like compiling for different OSs or translating.

It should be suitable for software, documentation, design/artwork, or anything
else really. It refers to the work in question as the "project" as it is a
suitably generic term.

## Breakdown

The first paragraph (after the obligatory copyright line) is to prevent us all
being sued. After that, the permissions paragraphs are numbered.

### Permission 1 - redistribute in entirety
This lets users redistribute the whole project. Easy.

### Permission 2 - redistribute source material
Users can leave out compiled executables or anything else which is defined
purely by the source material from their redistributions.

### Permission 3 - translate, reformat, compile
Users can distribute the project to help with reaching a wider audience, as long
as they don't change the meaning or functionality. This is intended to allow
people to compile code for a different OS, but could also allow text in a
different format (such as PDF) or translating to another language.

### Permission 4 - pull requests
Forks are allowed only if the user then intends to create a pull request later.
Without this one it'd be pretty difficult to allow people to contribute.

### Permission 5 - full permission to contributors
This is the big one. Any user who has contributed previously has full permission
similar to a permissive license such as MIT. The only difference is that the
contribution has to be clearly auditable.

Licensors should be aware that, by accepting a pull request, they are
granting MIT-like permission to that user.

## Contributing to the license text

This is a work in progress, and I'd appreciate contributions.

## Using the license

I don't think I'd recommend using this yet, as it's still in very early stages.
If you would like to use it (either as-is, or when it's more mature) please let
me know.

## Disclaimer

I'm not a lawyer. Use this license at your own risk. If your work gets
plagiarised or you get sued or any other bad stuff happens because of some
inadequacy in this license, you need to take full responsibility for that. If in
doubt, seek independent legal advice from a qualified professional.
